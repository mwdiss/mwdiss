I'm training AI agents, building automation, 🤖 <br>
I tinker with Arduino, for hardware creation. 🔌 <br>
Collaborate on security, I check the network flows, 🛡️ <br>
A little bit of vibe coding, just so everybody knows. 🎹 <br>

<br />

I really love my Python, I use it every day, 🐍 <br>
I build the automated things, in a cool and casual way. 😎 <br>
I'm just a chill guy, learning code and training bots, 🎓 <br>
I don't get into drama, I just connect the dots. 🔵

<br />

And I prefer a cat, I do not like a dog, 🐈 <br>
Because cat don't bark, they sleeps for long. 💤 <br>
They simply just exist, they bath, they eat, 🛁 <br>
They small, they quiet, the schedule is sweet. 🍬

### My Development Philosophy

If I search for a library and I don't find it in an hour... 🔍 <br>
And I get annoyed... 😤 <br>
Then I am busy to-day... 🚫 <br>
Bcuz I am making the 69th version of it, from scratch. 🛠️ <br>
<br>
If I have 67 hours a day... 🕰️ <br>
I will bloat everything I build with too many features. 🐡 <br>
And I will add buttons you don't need. 🔴 <br>
And I would say, 🗣️
